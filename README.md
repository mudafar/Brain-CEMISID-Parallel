## BrainCEMISID V2.1
The BrainCEMISID project is the University of Los Andes (Mérida-Venezuela) first cognitive architecture that tackles problems such as visual and auditive
 information representation, sensorial ambiguities solving, basic visual stimula composition into more complex cultural
 information, autonomous intentions-based decision making, among others.

## New in this version:
TO-DO:
* Make all of the neuronal networks parallel



## Installation

The BrainCEMISID kernel is written in Python 2.7. This means that all machines with a 2.7 Python interpreter can run the code.

###Kernel dependencies:
* Drill: download and follow installation instructions https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill

* Python multiprocessing library.

### UI (User interface) demo dependencies: 
* Kivy 1.9.1, available at https://kivy.org/#download. Follow the installation instructions.


###Running:
```python main.py```

Most of the modules, such as the MulticlassSingleLayerNetwork, contain independent tests that can be of help for the
comprehension of their functionality. Run, for instance:
 ```python multiclass_single_layer_network.py```
